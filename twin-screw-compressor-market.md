<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Twin Screw Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-free Twin Screw Compressor</li><li>Oil-Injected Twin Screw Compressor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The twin screw compressor market is segmented into two main types: oil-free and oil-injected twin screw compressors. Oil-free twin screw compressors operate without lubrication oil, making them ideal for applications requiring clean air, such as the food, pharmaceuticals, and electronics industries. In contrast, oil-injected twin screw compressors utilize oil for lubrication, which enhances efficiency and cooling but may introduce oil into the compressed air. These are commonly used in various industrial applications where oil contamination is not a concern.</p></p>
