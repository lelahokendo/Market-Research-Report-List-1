<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Generators in Fire Protection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Swing Adsorption</li><li>Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen generators in the fire protection market primarily utilize two technologies: Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and membrane separation. PSA systems function by adsorbing oxygen and other gases from air under pressure, releasing purified nitrogen for fire suppression applications. Conversely, membrane nitrogen generators employ selective permeable membranes that allow nitrogen to pass while retaining oxygen and moisture. Both technologies provide efficient, on-site nitrogen production, enhancing safety in various industries by reducing the risk of fire and improving overall systems reliability.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Nitrogen Generators in Fire Protection Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Fire Sprinkler Systems</li><li>Pre-Action Fire Sprinkler Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen generators play a crucial role in fire protection systems, particularly in dry and pre-action fire sprinkler systems. They produce nitrogen gas to purge air and moisture from the pipes, preventing corrosion and ensuring reliability during activation. In dry sprinkler systems, nitrogen maintains pressure and avoids water freezing in low-temperature environments. For pre-action systems, nitrogen enhances system integrity by keeping water out until a fire is detected, ensuring prompt and effective response without false activations.</p></p>
