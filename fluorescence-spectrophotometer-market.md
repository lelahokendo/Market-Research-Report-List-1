<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluorescence Spectrophotometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Beam Type</li><li>Double Beam Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fluorescence spectrophotometer market features two main types: single beam and double beam. Single beam spectrophotometers measure fluorescence by directing light through a sample and then detecting emitted light, ideal for applications requiring simplicity and lower costs. In contrast, double beam spectrophotometers use two optical paths—one for the sample and another for a reference—allowing for improved accuracy and stability by compensating for fluctuations in light intensity. Both types cater to diverse research and industrial applications.</p></p>
